# [2.0.0]
We're striving to reduce the distance between Flame and Bonfire, relying more and more on Flame components under the hood now that it is stable. In this version we are following the standardization of using `Vector2` for `position` and `size` and using `PositionComponent` as the base for Bonfire components. Also, 'FlameGame' and the Flame's Camera are now used instead of custom implementations we had before. Some small features were lost, but nothing that the Flame's team isn't capable of adding over time.

- Update to flame 1.0.
    - BREAKING CHANGE: Use `Vector2 size` instead of `double height` and `double width`.
    - BREAKING CHANGE: Use `Vector2` instead of `Offset` and `Size`.
    - BREAKING CHANGE: `camera.animateSimpleRotation` and `camera.animateLoopRotation` are not available anymore.
- Improvements in `ObjectCollision`. Now it is possible to override `onCollision` and return `false` so the object will not collide with anything or block the passage.
- Add new mixin `Pushable`.
- Add params `name` and `id` in `TiledObjectProperties`.
- Add support to use [Flame Effects](https://docs.flame-engine.org/1.0.0/effects.html)

- Improvements in `Lighting`
- Extensions improvements
- Improvements in `GameColorFilter`
- Add `left`,`right`,`top`,`bottom` in `GameComponent`
- Add `enabledSensor` in `Sensor`
- `SimpleDirectionAnimation` now only requires `idleRight` and `runRight`. It will automatically flip horizontally to perform the idle/run left animations. You can disable this feature setting the param `enabledFlipX` to false (default = true). `enabledFlipY` is also available, but defaults to false (if you set this param to true, only `idleUp` and `runUp` are needed).
- Bug fix in `getAnimation` (ImageExtension).
- Bug fix in `progress` (BonfireTiledWidget).
